This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a React application with Auth0. 
The sample makes use of Auth0's hosted login page which provides centralized authentication.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box and change the **domain** and **client ID** in `/src/Auth/auth0-variables.js`. The default URL is `http://localhost:3000/callback`. Also configure **Allowed Web Origins** to the default application URL `http://localhost:3000`.

Clone the repo or download it.

Open the demo.

```bash
cd name_the_repo
```

Install the dependencies for the app.

```
npm install
```

## Run the Application

The demo comes ready to serve locally using react-scripts.

```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.
